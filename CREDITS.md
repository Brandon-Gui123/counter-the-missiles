## Audio

### Soundtracks

Soundtacks by Eric Matyas (soundimage.org):

* "Analog Nostalgia" (looping variant)
* "Grunge Bot" (looping variant; fixed and enhanced in GarageBand for iOS so that there are no breaks when it loops)
* "Low Point" (looping variant)
* "Panoramic Dystopia" (looping variant)

### Sound Effects

* "Explosion7", "PowerRez5" and "Space-Cannon" by Eric Matyas (soundimage.org)
* "Low Ammo" and "Unusable Launcher" by Brandon Gui (that's me; I made this in GarageBand for iOS)

## Sprites

All of the sprites used are mine (made them in Adobe Photoshop), except for "Square", "Circle" and "Octagon" since those are available out-of-the-box in the Unity editor.

## Fonts

Inconsolata by Raph Levien (<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata>).
This is the font I use for readable text in settings, credits, help etc.

Megrim by Daniel Johnson (<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Megrim>).
This is the font I use for headings, titles, missile launcher status texts etc.
