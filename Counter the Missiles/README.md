# counter-the-missiles

*Counter the Missiles* is a game made with the Unity. It is based on *Missile Command*, a 1980 shoot 'em-up arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc.

This was made as a submission to one of my assignments back in Polytechnic education. I chose to work on this because the core mechanics and aesthetics of the game looked simple enough to re-create in the 1-month period we're given.

Right now, this resides on GitHub for public viewing. I also plan to use this project as a way to experiment and integrate new features from Unity. An example would be [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html), the new UI system inspired by web standards. I intend to replace [uGUI](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/index.html), the older UI system, with this.
